What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository adds a .git file in the repository. It is done so that all the files in the repository could be tracked for their commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area consists of files which have a logical change ready to be committed to the repository. It gives a logical separation of files that have been modifies for a particular change.
