When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there are multiple people working on the same piece of code, it's desirable to have a remote repository where each coder can push his/her local changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
ANS: I would want to pull changes from the remote only when the changes in the remote repository make logical sense and would not break the code in my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forking  is a process of getting a private copy of an existing repository on Github.
Clones are copies of existing remote repositories in a local machine.
Branches are different copies of the same codebase but each branch may be built from the same codebase but for different purposes.
